			Meteorological Service of New Zealand Limited (MetService - Te Ratonga Tirorangi) was established as a
			state-owned enterprise in 1992. It employs about 300 staff and its headquarters are in Wellington, New
			Zealand.
			Prior to becoming an SOE, New Zealand's national meteorological service has existed in a number of forms
			since
			the appointment of the country's first Director of Meteorological Stations in August 1861.
			As New Zealand's national meteorological service, MetService produces and issues forecasts and official
			weather
			warnings on behalf of New Zealand's Ministry of Transport and is certified by the Civil Aviation Authority
			of
			New Zealand.
			International media, aviation and energy business is conducted under the MetraWeather brand.
			MetService has been certified to the ISO 9001 standard since November 1995.[citation needed]

	<hr>
	<p>
		The weather forecasting service began in 1861, when a spate of shipwrecks prompted the Government to start a
		storm warning service as part of the then Marine Department.

		Forecasting remained a marine service until 1926, when it became part of the newly formed Department of
		Scientific and Industrial Research. In 1927 Edward Kidson was appointed Dominion Meteorologist by Earnest
		Marsden. At the time the New Zealand Meteorological Service was a very small institution with a staff of five
		and a complete lack of useful long-period meteorological records[1].

		At the outbreak of World War Two in 1939, forecasting became part of the Royal New Zealand Air Force. The focus
		on aviation continued with a move in 1964 to the then Department of Civil Aviation, which in 1968 became part of
		a new "super ministry", the Ministry of Transport.

		During the 1980s there was increasing pressure on government funding for meteorology in New Zealand, together
		with a government-wide move to "user-pays" for specialised services, and to more autonomy and accountability for
		government departments.[2] A combination of commercial competition in the deregulated market for meteorological
		services and reform of publicly funded science led to the establishment of MetService as a state-owned
		enterprise on 1 July 1992.[2]

		In 2013, MetService invested in a 49% shareholding in MetOcean Solutions Limited, a New Zealand oceanographic
		services company. MetOcean was an established company specialising in oceanographic analysis for research and
		forecasting for many purposes, including ports, offshore oil & gas industries and surfers.[3]

		In early September 2020, MetService's website came under a wave of distributed denial of service attacks that
		also targeted the New Zealand Exchange, Stuff, Radio New Zealand and Westpac bank.[4][5]

		The world's national meteorological and hydrological services work with the World Meteorological Organization
		(WMO), a specialised agency of the United Nations. As part of the WMO World Weather Watch, MetService sends
		observational data gathered from the New Zealand region to other WMO member countries around the world. This is
		used as input to computer models of the weather at the world's major numerical weather prediction centres.

		MetService operates a data collection network within New Zealand. It complies with recognised international
		standards as prescribed by the WMO over and around New Zealand. In particular, data are collected through:
	<ul>
		<li>Surface observations over New Zealand</li>
		<li>Upper air observations using a variety of means ground-based equipment, aircraft, weather radars</li>
		<li>Voluntary observing ships</li>
		<li>A network of drifting buoys in the Tasman Sea.</li>
	</ul>
	Norm Henry, General Manager of Science and Strategy, is the current permanent representative of New Zealand with the
	WMO.

		MetraWeather (Australia) Pty Ltd, MetraWeather (UK) Ltd and MetraWeather‌ (Thailand)‌ Ltd are wholly owned
		subsidiaries of Meteorological Service of New Zealand Limited, providing weather intelligence and information
		presentation products and services globally under the MetraWeather brand to:
	<ul>
		<li>Port and harbour managers and offshore oil & gas operators</li>
		<li>Transport and related infrastructure operations, including aviation, roading and rail</li>
		<li>Energy generators (combined cycle gas turbine operators, hydro power operators and wind farm operators),
			retailers and network managers</li>
		<li>Broadcast and interactive media, via the Weatherscape XT weather presentation system</li>
		<li>Retailers and logistics managers</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<h4 id="The_Pacific">The Pacific</h4>
	<hr>
	<p>
		MetService maintains close links with the meteorological agencies of various Pacific Island states.

		All warnings of hazardous weather for the South Pacific region, normally received from the Regional Specialized
		Meteorological Center in Nadi, Fiji, are forwarded to Radio New Zealand International and to the Ministry of
		Foreign Affairs and Trade.

		MetService provides backup for the main warning and forecasting responsibilities of the Regional Specialized
		Meteorological Center in Nadi, Fiji, should that centre temporarily shut down or be cut off, possibly due to a
		direct hit by a cyclone. They also take over Primary warning responsibility should a cyclone move to the south
		of 25S.

	<h4 id="Numerical_weather_prediction">Numerical weather prediction</h4>
	<hr>
	<p>
		The cooperative relationship among the world's national meteorological services enables the sharing of much
		weather information, including the output from global numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Meteorologists
		at MetService routinely use information from the world's major modelling centres for day-to-day production of
		forecasts and weather warnings.

		The global models that MetService uses generally provide reliable forecasts of weather features, like highs and
		lows, over forecast periods of several days; however, they are less effective at predicting small-scale weather
		features like sea breezes and localised showers. Such features are often strongly affected by the local
		geography, which tends to be poorly represented in the global models.

		An effective way of dealing with this problem is to use another type of NWP model known as a limited-area model.
		MetService routinely runs a number of limited-area models based on both MM5 and WRF with lateral boundary
		conditions provided by each of the available global models. The primary model configuration for regional
		forecasting in New Zealand has a horizontal spacing between grid points of 12 km, which allows weather features
		down to about 50 km wide to be represented (highs and lows are thousands of kilometres wide). This domain is
		nested within a much larger domain of 60 km grid spacing, which enables the weather to be modelled over quite a
		large geographical area for reasonable computational cost.
