	<hr>
	<p>The weather forecasting service began in 1861, when a spate of shipwrecks prompted the Government to start a
		storm warning service as part of the then <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Department_(New_Zealand)"
			title="Marine Department (New Zealand)">Marine Department</a>.
	</p>
	<p>Forecasting remained a marine service until 1926, when it became part of the newly formed <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Scientific_and_Industrial_Research_(New_Zealand)"
			title="Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (New Zealand)">Department of Scientific and
			Industrial Research</a>. In 1927 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Kidson"
			title="Edward Kidson">Edward Kidson</a> was
		appointed Dominion Meteorologist by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Marsden"
			title="Ernest Marsden">Earnest Marsden</a>.
		At the time the New Zealand Meteorological Service was a very small institution with a staff of five and a
		complete lack of useful long-period meteorological records.
	</p>
	<p>At the outbreak of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War Two</a> in
		1939, forecasting
		became part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_New_Zealand_Air_Force"
			title="Royal New Zealand Air Force">Royal New
			Zealand Air Force</a>. The focus on aviation continued with a move in 1964 to the then Department of Civil
		Aviation, which in 1968 became part of a new "super ministry", the <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Ministry_of_Transport"
			title="New Zealand Ministry of Transport">Ministry of
			Transport</a>.
	</p>
	<p>During the 1980s there was increasing pressure on government funding for meteorology in New Zealand, together
		with a government-wide move to "user-pays" for specialised services, and to more autonomy and accountability for
		government departments. A combination of commercial competition in
		the deregulated market for meteorological services and reform of publicly funded science led to the
		establishment of MetService as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprise"
			title="State-owned enterprise">state-owned enterprise</a> on 1 July 1992.
	</p>
	<p>In 2013, MetService invested in a 49% shareholding in MetOcean Solutions Limited, a New Zealand oceanographic
		services company. MetOcean was an established company specialising in oceanographic analysis for research and
		forecasting for many purposes, including ports, offshore oil &amp; gas industries and surfers.
	</p>
	<p>In early September 2020, MetService's website came under a wave of <a

			title="Distributed denial of service">distributed denial of service</a> attacks that

			title="World Meteorological Organization">World
			Meteorological Organization</a> (WMO), a specialised agency of the United Nations. As part of the WMO
		<i>World Weather Watch</i>, MetService sends observational data gathered from the New Zealand region to other
		WMO member countries around the world. This is used as input to computer models of the weather at the world's
		major <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_weather_prediction"
			title="Numerical weather prediction">numerical weather
			prediction</a> centres.
	</p>
	<p>MetService operates a data collection network within New Zealand. It complies with recognised international
		standards as prescribed by the WMO over and around New Zealand. In particular, data are collected through:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Surface observations over New Zealand</li>
		<li>Upper air observations using a variety of means <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_balloon"

	<p>MetService maintains close links with the meteorological agencies of various Pacific Island states.

		New
		Zealand International and to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
	</p>
	<p>MetService provides backup for the main warning and forecasting responsibilities of the Regional Specialized
		Meteorological Center in Nadi, Fiji, should that centre temporarily shut down or be cut off, possibly due to a
		direct hit by a cyclone. They also take over Primary warning responsibility should a cyclone move to the south
		of 25S.
	</p>

	<h4 id="Numerical_weather_prediction">Numerical weather prediction</h4>
	<hr>
	<p>The cooperative relationship among the world's national meteorological services enables the sharing of much
		weather information, including the output from global <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_weather_prediction"
			title="Numerical weather prediction">numerical weather prediction</a> (NWP) models. Meteorologists at
		MetService routinely use information from the world's major modelling centres for day-to-day production of
		forecasts and weather warnings.
	</p>
	<p>The global models that MetService uses generally provide reliable forecasts of weather features, like <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_pressure_area" title="High pressure area">highs</a> and <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_pressure_area" title="Low pressure area">lows</a>, over forecast
		periods
		of several days; however, they are less effective at predicting small-scale weather features like <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_breeze" title="Sea breeze">sea breezes</a> and localised showers.
		Such features are often
		strongly affected by the local geography, which tends to be poorly represented in the global models.
	</p>
	<p>An effective way of dealing with this problem is to use another type of NWP model known as a <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_model#Domains" title="Atmospheric model">limited-area
			model</a>. MetService
		routinely runs a number of limited-area models based on both <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MM5_(weather_model)" title="MM5 (weather model)">MM5</a> and <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Research_and_Forecasting_model"
			title="Weather Research and Forecasting model">WRF</a> with lateral boundary conditions
		provided by each of the available global models. The
		primary model configuration for regional forecasting in New Zealand has a horizontal spacing between grid points
		of 12&#160;km, which allows weather features down to about 50&#160;km wide to be represented (highs and lows are
		thousands of kilometres wide). This domain is nested within a much larger domain of 60&#160;km grid spacing,
		which enables the weather to be modelled over quite a large geographical area for reasonable computational cost.
